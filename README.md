# gtk_gl_area_examples

Examples for Gtk::GLArea

Inspired by https://github.com/gummybears/opengl_with_crystal

To run the code for a example, go to
corresponding directory. Make sure
the script build.sh is executable and then
execute the following commands from
your terminal

```sh
$ shards install
$ ./build.sh
$ ./a.out
```

The build.sh script will compile and link a example
and produces the executable a.out
